## Description

> Building spaces for learning, experimentation and playing with technology has always been challenging, and as the pandemic forced us to change many aspects of our lives, how do we continue building these very important spaces? Techcultivation has invited speakers who've built such spaces to share their experiences, and what they would like to let us all know about building hackspaces, coding groups and other community driven spaces.
